# NLP Projects Collection ðŸ“Ÿ

This repository contains five Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, each designed to extract meaning or make predictions from unstructured text. All projects follow a common pipeline: text cleaning, tokenization, vectorization, and model training.

## 1. Fake News Classification

This model classifies news articles as real or fake based on their content.

- **Dataset:** News articles labeled `real` or `fake`
- **Output:** Real/Fake classification

---

## 2. IMDb Movie Recommendation

A movie recommender system that analyzes plot summaries and suggests similar titles.

- **Dataset:** IMDb plots and metadata
- **Output:** List of similar movies based on input

---

## 3. Topic Modelling - Indian Express

Identifies underlying topics in Indian Express news articles.

- **Dataset:** News articles from Indian Express
- **Output:** Dominant topics per article

---

## 4. MyECHO (BERT-based Model)

MyECHO uses a fine-tuned BERT model to interpret and classify contextual user input. It excels in tasks where meaning depends heavily on sentence structure and nuance.

- **Dataset:** Custom contextual inputs
- **Model:** BERT
- **Output:** Classification or intent-based labels

---

## 5. Sentiment Analysis

Analyzes the sentiment of user input text, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Dataset:** Tweets, product reviews, or user comments
- **Output:** Sentiment label

---

## Common NLP Pipeline

All projects follow this industry standard workflow for NLP:

1. **Text Cleaning:**  
   - Lowercasing, punctuation/special character removal  
   - Stopwords removal and lemmatization

2. **Tokenization:**  
   - Word-level tokenization

3. **Vectorization:**  
   - Text-to-numerical representation (e.g., TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer)

4. **Model Training:**  
   - Trained using classical ML or custom logic (except MyECHO)

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
